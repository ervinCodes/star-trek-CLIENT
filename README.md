## Overview

### Project Details

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- Enter an alien name from the Star Trek universe and be able to retrieve information about the species. For example: home world, distinguishing features, interesting facts and notable examples.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML & CSS
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

### What I learned

When I began this project I initially created an API that contained all the information I would need on the aliens information and had it hosted on Heroku so that I could use it for this site. I then learned how to transfer the information to MongoDB for faster performance.

### Continued development

As of now, the application is only able to get/read information from the database. When I revisit this project, I would like for the user to be able to create any character from the Star Trek universe and have that information stored in the database.
